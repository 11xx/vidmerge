# [2023-06-29]
- First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.
- Added =bytestring= to library stanza in =.cabal= file.
- Added =process= to library stanza in =.cabal= file.
- Added =optparse-applicative= to executable stanza in =.cabal= file.
- Minimal test functionality with =file.mp4= and =output.txt= input and
  output files.
- Added =knob= to library stanza in =.cabal= file.
  + Create virtual files to serve as RAM-based Handle to buffer the
    output of the shell command. See [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/knob-0.2.2/docs/Data-Knob.html][Data.Knob]].
