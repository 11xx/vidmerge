* Revision history for vidmerge

** 0.8.0.0
- Add =-v=, =--verbose= flag
  + Add some verbose debugging messages to get the state of some
    variables.
- Add =-s=, =--match-shortest= flag
  + Find shortest match by looping the csv'd lines of file1 with the
    md5 fields of csv'd lines of file2, with a loop cap at the array
    length/lines of csv'd lines of file1. So if file1 is bigger than
    file2 and it finds no md5 matches it will take longer and fail.
    #FIXME
  + Assign values to the concat file variable based on the =-s= flag.
- Add ffmpeg flag
  + =-loglevel warning=: Makes it less verbose but still warns about
    audio and video desync caused by different timebases from two
    different and unmatching files. Note that correct videos but that
    need fixup may also trigger this warning.
- Abstract some more functions in main into library
- Use =[INFO]=, =[DEBUG]=, =[ERROR]= and =[PROMPT]= as prefix for printing to
  the terminal, currently they always have color.
- Create library modules
  + IO.Colors: set =System.Console.ANSI= helpers, currently only using
    =hSetSGR stderr [...]=.
  + IO.Debug: Helpers to use with verbose flag
  + IO.Info: Helpers to print normal messages to the terminal
  + IO.Prompt: Helper to querying terminal input such as =y/n=
    confirmation.
- Create the =*.frameindex.txt= file only dropping one extension of
  file1 instead of all.
- Clarify "Automatically" in cabal description.

  Same functionality as =0.5=.

# [2023-07-05 Wed 20:05:43 -03]
- Add =directory= dependency.
- Better logic with helper functions on main
- Parse timebase (tb) values and convert pts to seconds
- Experimental print of concat file

** 0.4.1.0
# [2023-07-03 Mon 14:19:10 -03]
- Add =#tb= timebase "line finding"
- Create =Parse.ByteString.List= library module for some bytestring
  alternatives of =Parse.List=.
- Move stderr error messages to helper function

** 0.4.0.0
# [2023-07-03 Mon 02:00:15 -03]

- Add exectable dependencies =split=, =containers= and =ansi-terminal=.
- Changed main binary to, after writing frameindex, parse it's comma
  separated values into a list of lists for each file and;
- Compare the last hash item from the last list of lists and find a
  list with a matching hash on the second list of lists and print that
  list.
  Experimental state.
- Add exit code and colored stderr text.
- Create =Parse.List= module file in library

- Added type definitions

** 0.3.0.0
# [2023-07-02 Sun 15:14:56 -03]
- Moved and renamed functions and some logic from library to binary to
  focus on IO purity and side-effects.
- Added cabal ghc option compila flags for more strict warnings
- Addressed compile warnings

** 0.2.1.0
# [2023-07-02 Sun 00:00:59 -03]
- Added fps probe and print to the screen

** 0.2.0.0
# [2023-06-30 Fri 20:31:15 -03]
- Added =filepath= dependency.
- Changed binary to generate two frameindex frames from two input
  video files, the output filenames of the frameindex.txt files are
  made by replacing the input file name's extension.

** 0.1.0.0
# [2023-06-29]
- Added command-line parsing
  + Accept files with =-f= and =-o= or first an input and second an
    output file. This is just experimenting generating framemd5 dump
    files with command-line specified arguments.

** 0.0.0.0
# [2023-06-29]
- First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.
- Added =bytestring= to library stanza in =.cabal= file.
- Added =process= to library stanza in =.cabal= file.
- Added =optparse-applicative= to executable stanza in =.cabal= file.
- Minimal test functionality with =file.mp4= and =output.txt= input and
  output files.
- Added =knob= to library stanza in =.cabal= file.
  + Create virtual files to serve as RAM-based Handle to buffer the
    output of the shell command. See [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/knob-0.2.2/docs/Data-Knob.html][Data.Knob]].
